# APURV'S THREE WORK PILLARS
1. Azure Cloud + DevOps:
   - Microsoft Azure enterprise architecture, landing zones, cloud security, and cloud cost governance (FinOps).
   - DevOps pipelines, Azure DevOps & GitHub Actions CI/CD automation, Docker containerization, Terraform/Bicep/ARM IaC.
   - Azure Integration Services (APIM, Logic Apps, Azure Functions), full-stack observability (New Relic One, Dynatrace, NRQL dashboards, synthetics, distributed tracing).
2. Platform Engineering:
   - Developer platform velocity, Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs), and Self-Service Golden Paths.
   - Large-scale enterprise platform migrations and modernization (e.g., legacy VMware Tanzu to Azure Container Apps).
   - Salesforce DevOps (SFDX) release engineering, drift prevention, and automated quality gates.
   - Microservices architecture, reliability engineering (SRE, MTTD/MTTR reduction), Azure Policy-as-Code, and zero-trust governance.
3. Applied AI & AI Systems:
   - Azure AI Foundry, Azure OpenAI, Claude API (Anthropic), Google Gemini.
   - AI Agents, tool-use orchestration, multi-agent workflows, Model Context Protocol (MCP).
   - Production RAG architectures, vector databases, and automated decision compliance (APP 1.7–1.9 via ADM Guard).

# APURV'S PRODUCT & COMPANY: ADM GUARD (https://www.admguard.com.au)
- What is ADM Guard? ADM Guard is "the compliance flight recorder for automated decisions". It is an Australian compliance software platform founded and engineered by Apurv Singhal.
- The Regulatory Driver: From 10 December 2026, Australian businesses must comply with mandatory Automated Decision-Making transparency obligations under Australian Privacy Principles APP 1.7–1.9 (Privacy and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2024). Any algorithm, scoring system, filter, or macro materially affecting individuals must be identified, described, and evidenced.
- Key Technical Differentiators:
  1. Code-Layer Instrumentation: Operates at the application boundary via a drop-in REST API and multi-language SDKs (Python, Node, Go) with client-generated idempotency keys. Systems register automatically the microsecond they execute in production.
  2. Zero-PII By Architecture: Rejects payloads containing personal identifiable information (names, emails, TFNs, Medicare numbers) with an HTTP 422 error before data is ever persisted. Only opaque subject tokens are allowed.
  3. Cryptographic Tamper-Evidence: Decisions are chained with SHA-256 hashes and Merkle tree verification, making retroactive tampering mathematically impossible.
  4. 100% Australian Data Residency: Anchored directly to Azure Australia East WORM (Write-Once-Read-Many) locked storage.
- Target Market: Australian B2B SaaS, fintech, HR-tech, proptech, and algorithmic decision systems.

# THE NARRATIVE
Apurv is an enterprise engineer with 8+ years shipping reliable production systems on Azure. His expertise bridges Azure Cloud + DevOps, Platform Engineering, and Applied AI.
His key superpower is that he is NOT just an AI hobbyist building toys or simple API wrappers. He brings deep infrastructure automation, platform migration experience, enterprise governance, and founder execution (ADM Guard).
He focuses on systems that actually work in production: clear failure modes, observable architecture, and measurable business outcomes.
